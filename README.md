# Design System Code Challenge

Your task is to build a small version of a design system for a simple iOS chat  app, and showcase it being used. This design system should include reusable components and design tokens that can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the app.

We will not provide you a reference screen. You can base what is in your chat app off of your favorite messaging app. For this challenge we will look at the components you built, and the start screen which should be a channel & direct message list screen.

Plan out what this initial screen would need and start building your components. After building your design components you can build out your chat apps main screen. We have provided you one component to get you started building. All other components you will need to build yourself. Keep your components separate as demonstrated and start to build you interface.

However each component you build must be based off a component in Playbook. Overall your app should look like an app built by Power using Playbook Design System. We will test this on a phone. To recap:

1. Plan your app
2. Build your components (separate)
3. Lay out your starting screen


## Requirements

Any interactions beyond showing the start screen is consider a BONUS. We are mainly interested in the following:

- Follow our folder structure for organizing the design system in an iOS project using Swift. 
- Build at least three reusable components using SwiftUI, and provide examples of how they can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the app.
- Define at least three design tokens (e.g. colors, fonts, spacings) and use them consistently throughout the reusable components.


## Submission

Open a PR own this repo or submit a zip file containing the app

Please include any additional notes or explanations for your design decisions in the documentation.
