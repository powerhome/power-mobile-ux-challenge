# Design System Code Challenge

Your task is to build a small version of a design system for a simple iOS chat app, and showcase it being used. This design system should include reusable components and design tokens that can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the app.

For the app portion, keep it simple. Build a simple two-screen app. The first screen will be a list of users, and the second is a settings screen that can be accessed by tapping on a user. Use the screenshots below as a reference for the design and layout.


## Requirements

- Follow our folder structure for organizing the design system in an iOS project using Swift. We've already built an Avatar component as an example. (Feel free to restructure the Avatar or change it up, if you need to.)
- Build at least three reusable components using SwiftUI, and provide examples of how they can be easily customized and integrated into different parts of the app.
- Define at least three design tokens (e.g. colors, fonts, spacings) and use them consistently throughout the reusable components.
- Provide clear and concise documentation for how to use the design system, including how to customize and integrate the reusable components and how to use the design tokens.

## Screenshots

Here are some lo-fiâ€™s of what the app might look like using the design system:

## Submission

Please submit a zip file containing the following:

- The folder structure for the design system, including all the necessary Swift files for the reusable components and design tokens.
- Examples of how the reusable components can be customized and integrated into different parts of the app.
- The documentation for the design system.

Please include any additional notes or explanations for your design decisions in the documentation.
